    <p class="roodparagraphen">
        I was always extremely passionate about sport and muscle building since my childhood.
        When I started studying I moved to the city, where I could finally buy my first membership
        (in January 2013). From that time fitness has become a huge part of my life, and it has never
        changed since. Here is a short video my 5 years transformation story (2013-2018).

<h2 class="hoofdingen2">Armwrestling</h2>
    <p class="groenparagraphen">
        Even I broke my elbow when I was 15 years old during an armwrestling match, I still love doing it.
        It's just an ultimate competition and a combat sport between two people in arm strength.
        It's just the feeling you get.

<h3 class="hoofdingen3">Travelling</h3>
    <p class="blauwparagraphen">
        Traveling fosters a medium to build human connections with one another by learning about culture,
        food, new sites, music, and the way people live their day to day lives in different parts
        of the world. It's the best on-site learning a person can get. The internet can only explain
        so much about a place.
